# Eniac_Discounts
This project looks into the impact of discounts on the company's revenues.
# Project Reflection Template 
## Summary 
This project was created to help make data-driven decisions for Eniac on the seasonality of discounts, their impact on revenues, quantity purchased, and the popularity of the brand. 
## Languages and Libraries Used 
The main tools used for this project were Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn).
## Key Learnings 
After hours of data cleaning, we analyzed and visualized this complex dataset which led us to provide the Eniac marketing team with a few recommendations.
One of the first key learnings is, when looking at seasonality, discounts during special holidays (mainly Christmas and Black Friday) have a huge impact on the number of sales and their value.
The second key learning was that low discounts (up to 35%) brought the most revenue to the company, after that point, the higher the discounts, the lower the revenues.
## Challenges Overcame 
The dataset was deeply flawed. Out of almost 300k rows, we ended up analyzing and visualizing only about 45k rows. In fact, one of our recommendations for the marketing team was to provide more concise and clean data.
